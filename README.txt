This Ray Tracer was produced by Michael Tarantino

Features include:
-Plane, Sphere, Triangle and Mesh objects
-Light and Camera objects
-Phong Lighting model
-Shadow Ray logic
-Anti-aliasing
-Soft shadow calculations

Note: There seems to be an issue with determining shadows caused 
by triangles and triangular meshes. For some reason, triangles can't cast any.
